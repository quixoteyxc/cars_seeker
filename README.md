## Project overview 

The Car Dealer Application allows users to filter vehicles by make (brand) and model year. 
The application fetches vehicle data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) 
API and displays it in a clean and user-friendly interface built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. 
Users can select a vehicle make and a model year from dropdown menus, and then view a 
list of vehicles matching their selection on a results page.
